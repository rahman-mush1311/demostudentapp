# demostudentapp
Final version of demo crud application(student application)using mysql jpa and spring boot.
Getting familiar using spring framework. This is a part of an assignment. 
a rest api is built to serve simple insert,update,delete and read operation. 
the api is tested on postman as there is no user interference to hit the controller.
